# EventSPL
Sound and Weather monitoring system for live events.

While working on live events, I regularly spend far too much of my time walking from point to point to measure sound levels and wind 
speeds at various locations and coordinating between different teams. 

An example use case; with wind being a contribution to sound propagation and a risk to temporary structures, teams responsible for both
areas of the event need to be notified if wind speed becomes too high so the system should be able to send notifications around sites and 
keep the entire team up to date with the information they need.

The plan is to extend the system into all areas of the event and provide a wide range of different sensors so the system can provide a 
dashboard overview of conditions across the site and potentially making decisions like when to turn on site lighting in different areas.

I have started a GoFundMe in order to raise money for some of the hardware I need to fully develop the project: https://gf.me/u/xpxcwu

The basic code for SPL measurement is working, but I am yet to integrate the telemetry side of things. Once that's done, I'll start 
posting the code. Unfortunately, at the moment, this is a spare time project and I'm not getting a lot of spare time. If I raise enough 
money, I'll schedule some work time to speed up the progress.
